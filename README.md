Automization and Reshoring
===========================================================
**Katja Mann, Lukas PÃ¼ttmann (2015)**


1. Do a text search through the corpus of United States patent texts. Look for words with "autom" in them.

2. Count the number of times the keyword appears in the patent description.

3. Match patent to industries. Patent classifications have already been matched to industry sectors. 

4. Look at how our index correlates with:
1. other indices for automatization
2. offshoring indices
